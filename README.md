Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Daniel. If you read this, it might well be that I sent you the link so you can learn more about working with me. Or you might just have stumbled upon this page, in which case: Nice to meet you! :)

This is my [Personal User Manual](https://theunconventionalroute.com/personal-user-manual/). If your experience with me is different or you think there is a way this document might be more useful, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/dbartholomae/dbartholomae/issues/new) or [suggest a change](https://github.com/dbartholomae/dbartholomae/edit/main/README.md).

## Who am I?

I'm a Berlin based founder, manager and developer. I have a faible for technology, data and self management. Currently my focus is on making it easy to solve business problems with TypeScript based web technology.

### My professional history

You can find my professional exploits on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bartholomae/).

### Where to find me online

It is easiest to reach me [via email](mailto:info@bartholomae.name), but you can also [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdbartholomae%2Fdbartholomae%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&screen_name=The_Startup_CTO&tw_p=followbutton). From time to time I also write [blog articles](http://startup-cto.net/).

## Understanding me

### My believes and how they manifest

* No one is intrinsically bad. Therefore I always __believe in good intentions__ until proven otherwise.
* __Caring about each other__ makes life better for everyone. Therefore I try to take care of everyone in my sphere of influence.
* We should all in principle __follow the same rules__ and therefore I have a hard time with rules that donâ€™t apply universally.
* Working in a group where __everyone gives their best__ is more pleasant and effective than everyone "just doing their job". This doesn't mean spending every wake hour on the job, or not having off days. It is about attitude. Therefore I try to hold everyone including myself up to the highest standards.
* __Transparency and candor__ both make working more pleasant and effective. Therefore I like to discuss ideas openly and get feedback from others.
* __Making mistakes__ and learning from them is an important part of life. Therefore I always look for what to learn from mistakes, never for punishing anyone involved.
* The only way to find out something is to actually try it. Therefore I am usually looking for an __experiment that allows to get feedback with the least energy required__. It makes sense to learn from what others have learnt to find the right experiments, but then skipping the experiment alltogether is dangerous.
* Especially in software development we tend to plan too much ahead. Therefore I prefer __just-in-time optimization__: Not too early where I don't know yet what to optimize for, but only when the optimization actually becomes necessary.

### What people tell me I'm good at

* __Building and coaching teams and individuals__ to achieve great things while having fun.
* Meaning well and __deeply caring about the people I work with__.
* __Helping others__ to be successful.
* __Rapidly understanding complex problems__ by probing with questions and thinking through topics.
* Forcing __decisions not to do things__ instead of wasting time on something that might not be the most effective way to go forward.

### My quirks

* I can be __very direct__. Please let me know if I am too direct. Feel free to be direct and open with me yourself to let me know.
* It can be __hard to read my emotions__. Sometimes this means that I donâ€™t seem appropriately concerned, but me remaining calm does not mean that I do not care or do not take the situation seriously. If you are unsure about my emotions, feel free to just ask.
* Entertaining large groups of people isn't my strong suit. I prefer to __meet one-on-one and in smaller groups__.
* I'm especially __bad at remembering things__. This is one of the reasons why I prefer written communication where I can just look things up.
* Following orders can be hard for me. Specifically it is __hard for me to do things without understanding__ the reasoning behind it, or at least why there is no time to understand that reasoning right now. This also sometimes leads me to interfere with other peoples' responsibilities.

### Handling stress

I am not easily stressed and will remain calm even in situations where others might freak out. Should I ever get stressed out, the symptoms are that I withdraw and become even more silent. If you feel I no longer openly and transparently communicate, please privately tell me so I can reflect and bring back communication.

## Working with me

### Productive times

My productive times can vary by day. I tend to be more productive later in the day, though, and usually prefer not starting work before 09:00 am.

### Communicating with me

Feel free to be direct with me. I am not easily offended.

For communication I usually prefer written communication above talking as it gives you the time to optimize your message (e. g. using a [top-down structure](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7)) and me the ability to understand in my own time and potentially include others into the conversation where beneficial.

I feel confident in my triaging skills. If in doubt, you can include me in written communication and I will take care of sorting out what is important for me and what is not.

If you would prefer personal communication, feel free to schedule something into my calendar. My calendar is usually well-managed.

### Emergency communication

If you need an immediate response from me, please __send me an SMS or call me on the phone__. Due to the nature of my work I'm trying to manage my time in larger, uninterrupted chunks where possible and might not check e. g. email or Slack for longer amounts of time.

If you don't have my phone number but think you might need it, just let me know.

## Other

### Preferred pronouns

My preferred pronouns are `he/him/his`.

### How to pronounce my name

Daniel can either be pronounced [Daniel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/De-Daniel.ogg) in German or [Daniel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Daniel#Pronunciation) in English. Bartholomae is pronounced as [&#712;batolome](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%E2%80%8B%CB%88%E2%80%8Bbatolome&voice=Marlene). I don't really care though as long as I know that you are talking about me.

### Dietary restrictions

* I don't eat cheese, don't drink alcohol and don't drink coffee. Weird combination, huh? :)
* I try to avoid meat, or at least to buy organic, but I'm not very good at following through with this yet.
* If in doubt, Thai or Vietnamese cuisine is always fine.

### My favorite business books

### Obligatory fun fact

I once managed to forget my own first name for a couple seconds when asked to introduce myself.
